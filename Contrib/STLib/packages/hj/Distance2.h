//! Finite differences for computing distance.

  \param T is the number type.

  Finite differences for computing distance by solving the eikonal 
  equation \f$ | \nabla u | = 1 \f$.

  This class does not know anything about the solution or status
  grids.  This class defines protected member functions that perform
  finite difference operations.  It provides functionality for both
  adjacent and adjacent-diagonal difference schemes.  Classes that
  derive from \c Distance call these low-level functions.
