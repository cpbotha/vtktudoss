\section elc_introduction Introduction

This package handles the communication between the Lagrangian solid solver
and the Eulerian fluid solver in the VTF.

This is a templated class library.  
Thus there is no library to compile or link with.  Just include the 
appropriate header files in your application code when you compile.

When the Lagrangian solvers have a solid mesh, the boundary of the mesh
is communicated to the Eulerian solvers and the fluid pressures at the
boundary nodes are communicated back to the Lagrangian solvers.
The elc::LagrangianCommBoundary and elc::EulerianCommBoundary classes 
implement point-to-point communication between the solid and fluid.

When the Lagrangian solvers have a shell, the shell is sent to the Eulerian
solvers and the pressure differences across the shell faces are sent back.
The elc::LagrangianCommShell and elc::EulerianCommShell classes 
implement the point-to-point communication in this case.


\section elc_coupled_simulation The Coupled Simulation

In the coupled Eulerian/Lagrangian VTF simulation, the solid mesh
and the fluid grid are each distributed over a number of processors.
The typical VTF simulation is in 3-D and uses an AMR (Adaptive Mesh
Refinement) fluid grid.  For the sake of simplicity, we will
illustrate everything in 2-D with a unigrid fluid mesh.  We consider
the case of a 2-D solid (instead of a shell).  Below we show a 
diagram of a solid mesh and a fluid grid.  We indicate how the fluid
grid is distributed over 8 processors.

At each time step, the fluid needs the position and velocity of 
the solid boundary.  This is used in the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) to
enforce boundary conditions at the solid/fluid interface.  In return, 
the solid solvers need the fluid pressure at the boundary nodes.

The solid mesh is distributed.  Below we show a distribution of the 
boundary over 9 processors.

\section elc_gather_send_broadcast The Gather-Send-Broadcast Algorithm

Before presenting the point-to-point coupling algorithm used in ELC, we 
introduce a simple coupling algorithm.
One way of communicating the solid boundary to the fluid processors is the
gather-send-broadcast algorithm.  The process is illustrated below.
9 solid processors communicate the solid boundary to 8 fluid processors.

\image html boundary_gather_send_broadcast.jpg "The gather-send-broadcast algorithm."
\image latex boundary_gather_send_broadcast.pdf "The gather-send-broadcast algorithm." width=\textwidth

The gather-send-broadcast algorithm communicates the solid boundary
to the fluid in three steps:
- <b>Gather.</b>  
The solid processors perform a gather operation to collect the 
portions of the boundary to the root solid processor.  There the pieces 
are sewn together to make one cohesive mesh.  
- <b>Send.</b>  
The assembled boundary mesh is then sent to the root fluid processor.  
- <b>Broadcast.</b>  
The fluid processors then perform a broadcast
operation to send the assembled boundary to each fluid processor.  

Each fluid processor can then select the portion of the assembled solid 
boundary that is relevant to its domain and use the closest point 
transform (CPT) to build the level set description of the boundary.

Communicating the fluid pressures to the solid is done with analogous 
operations:
- <b>Gather.</b>  
The fluid processors each set the pressure for the boundary nodes within 
their domain.  Then a gather operation collects the pressures to the root.
- <b>Send.</b>  
The fluid root then sends the pressures on the assembled boundary to the 
solid root.  
- <b>Broadcast.</b>  
The solid 
processors broadcast the pressures for the assembled boundary and then 
select the values for their portion of the boundary.

The gather-send-broadcast algorithm has a number of advantages:
- It is easy to implement.
- The number of communications is small.
- It does not depend on the distribution of the solid or fluid meshes.

The gather-send-brodcast is simple and flexible.  However, for large 
problems it may have poor performance due to the need to assemble, store
and communicate the global solid boundary.  
For the solid processors, assembling the global solid boundary may 
be costly (execution time) or infeasible (memory requirements) for 
large meshes.  Note that each fluid processor receives the global boundary, 
though it only needs the portion that intersects its domain.  
Storing the global boundary may be infeasible;
extracting the relevant portion of the boundary may be costly.



\section elc_point_to_point A Point-To-Point Communication Pattern

Now we present a point-to-point pattern for communicating the solid
boundary and the fluid pressures at the boundary nodes.  The communication
pattern is determined by using bounding box information from the distributed
solid boundary and fluid grids.  (The point-to-point communication
pattern is implemented in the Point-to-Point Bounding Box package.)

Each solid processor makes a bounding box around its portion of the 
boundary.  Each fluid processor makes a bounding box that contains its
region of interest.  Any portion of the solid boundary in the region of
interest could influence the fluid grid.  These are illustrated below.

\image html solid_fluid_bbox.jpg "The solid and fluid bounding boxes."
\image latex solid_fluid_bbox.pdf "The solid and fluid bounding boxes." width=\textwidth

The solid processors perform a gather operation to collect the bounding
box information to the root.  The fluid processors do the same.

\image html bbox_gather.jpg "Gather the solid and fluid bounding boxes."
\image latex bbox_gather.pdf "Gather the solid and fluid bounding boxes." width=\textwidth

Next the two root processors exchang the collected bounding boxes.

\image html bbox_exchange.jpg "Exchange the collected solid and fluid bounding boxes."
\image latex bbox_exchange.pdf "Exchange the collected solid and fluid bounding boxes." width=0.3\textwidth

Then the solid processors broadcast the fluid regions of interest and the 
fluid processors broadcast the solid boundary bounding boxes.

\image html bbox_broadcast.jpg "Broadcast the collected solid and fluid bounding boxes."
\image latex bbox_broadcast.pdf "Broadcast the collected solid and fluid bounding boxes." width=\textwidth

Now each solid processor has all the fluid regions of interest and each
fluid processor has all the solid bounding boxes.  Each solid processor
finds the fluid regions of interest which overlap its bounding box.  This
determines the fluid processors to which it will send its portion of
the boundary.  Analogously, each fluid processor finds
the solid bounding boxes which overlap its region of interest.  This
determines the solid processors from which it will receive portions of
the boundary.  The point-to-point communication from the solid to 
the fluid is illustrated below.

\section elc_comm_with_p2p Communicating with the Point-To-Point Scheme

Once the point-to-point communication pattern is determined (with
the point-to-point bounding box package), each solid processor sends
its portion of the boundary to the relevant fluid processors.  Each
fluid processor receives the relevant portions of the boundary and
assembles these portions into a single cohesive mesh.  It uses this
mesh to compute the CPT.  Then the pressure is determined at the
nodes of the boundary mesh (with the Grid
Interpolation/Extrapolation sub-package of the Numerical Algorithms
package.)  The pressures are then transfered to each portion of the
boundary.  Finally the pressures are sent back to the solid
processor from whence the portion of the boundary came.
  
Like the gather-send-broadcast approach, 
the point-to-point communication scheme does not depend on any special
distribution of the data.  For reasonable data distributions, 
it has a number of advantages:
- It reduces the cost of assembling the boundary.  Instead of assembling
the entire boundary on the solid root, each fluid processor assembles only
the relevant portion of the boundary.
- It reduces the storage overhead for the boundary.  The global solid 
boundary is never assembled.




\section elc_usage_lag Usage on the Lagrangian Processors

In each Lagrangian processor, instatiate one of the ELC Lagrangian 
communicators.  

\verbatim
elc::LagrangianComm<3,Number> 
  lagrangianComm(MPI_COMM_WORLD, comm, numEulerian, eulerianRoot, elc::LocalIndices); \endverbatim

Here, \c Number is probably \c double, 
\c comm is the Lagrangian communicator, \c numEulerian is the 
number of Eulerian processors, and \c eulerianRoot is the rank of
the root Eulerian processor in the world communicator.  For the last argument
one can either pass \c elc::LocalIndices or \c elc::GlobalIdentifiers.  This 
indicates how one will specify the mesh in sendMesh().  The connectivities 
array may either contain indices of the local mesh, or global node identifiers.

To send the mesh to the Eulerian processors, do the following.

\verbatim
lagrangianComm.sendMesh(numNodes, identifiers, positions, velocities,
                        numFaces, connectivities);
lagrangianComm.waitForMesh(); \endverbatim

Here, \c identifiers, \c positions, \c velocities, and \c connectivities 
are arrays of data that define the mesh.  One can perform computations 
between \c sendMesh() and \c waitForMesh().  Upon completion of 
\c waitForMesh(), mesh array data has been copied into communication buffers, 
and thus the data may be modified.

To receive the pressure data from the Eulerian processors, use 
\c receivePressure() and \c waitForPressure().  Below we receive the 
pressure defined at the nodes.

\verbatim
lagrangianComm.receivePressure(numNodes, pressures);
lagrangianComm.waitForPressure(); \endverbatim

If the Lagrangian mesh is a shell, then the pressure is defined at the
centroids of the faces.

\verbatim
lagrangianComm.receivePressure(numFaces, pressures);
lagrangianComm.waitForPressure(); \endverbatim

One can perform computations between \c receivePressure() and 
\c waitForPressure().  The former initiates non-blocking receives, so it is
best to call this function before the Eulerian processors start sending
the pressure.




\section elc_usage_eul Usage on the Eulerian Processors

In each Eulerian processor, instatiate one of the ELC Eulerian 
communicators.  For coupling with the boundary of a solid mesh, use:

\verbatim
elc::EulerianCommBoundary<3,Number> 
  eulerianComm(MPI_COMM_WORLD, comm, numLagrangian, lagrangianRoot, elc::LocalIndices); \endverbatim

For coupling with a shell mesh, use:

\verbatim
elc::EulerianCommShell<3,Number> 
  eulerianComm(MPI_COMM_WORLD, comm, numLagrangian, lagrangianRoot, elc::LocalIndices); \endverbatim

Here, \c comm is the Eulerian communicator, \c numLagrangian is the 
number of Lagrangian processors, and \c lagrangianRoot is the rank of
the root Lagrangian processor in the world communicator.
For the last argument
one can either pass \c elc::LocalIndices or \c elc::GlobalIdentifiers.  This 
indicates how the mesh patches are specified in the Lagrangian processors' 
call to sendMesh().  There, the connectivities 
array may either contain indices of the local mesh, or global node identifiers.

To receive the mesh from the Lagrangian processors, do the following.

\verbatim
eulerianComm.receiveMesh(region);
eulerianComm.waitForMesh(); \endverbatim

Here, \c region is an array of 6 floating point numbers that define 
the bounding box containing all of the processors' grids.  One can 
perform computations between \c receiveMesh() and \c waitForMesh().

After setting the pressure with the \c getPressures() or the 
\c getPressuresData()
member functions, send the pressure to the relevant Lagrangian processors.

\verbatim
eulerianComm.sendPressure();
eulerianComm.waitForPressure(); \endverbatim
