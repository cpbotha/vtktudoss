  \defgroup concurrent_partition_BspTree Partitioning a Regular Grid with a BSP Tree.

These functions partition the elements elements in a regular grid 
(1-D, 2-D, or 3-D).  Each element has an associated cost.  The 
algorithm tries to equitably divide the cost while keeping small boundaries
between the partitions.  The size of the boundary between partitions 
proportional to the communication costs for adjacent interactions between
the elements.

A binary-space-partition tree is used to divide the grid elements.  The 
elements are recursively divided into two groups.  The sub-grid containing
the elements is split along its longest dimension and the elements are 
divided to to equitably distribute the cost.  If there are \e N grid
elements and \e P partitions, the computational complexity of the 
algorithm in \f$\mathcal{O}(N \log P)\f$.  

Because partitioning is fast, I don't see the need for a dynamic algorithm.
Consider a 100 x 100 x 100 grid whose elements costs are drawn from a 
uniform random distribution.  Generating partitions of size 10, 100, and 1000
takes 0.08, 0.15, and 0.22 seconds, respectively, on a 1.66 GHz Intel Core
Duo.

Except for very small problems, it is impossible to compute the "best" 
partitioning.  There are \f$P^N\f$ ways of partitioning \e N elements into
\c P groups.  If we make the simplifying assumption that each group is of
size \f$N / P\f$, this is reduced to \f$N! / ((N / P)!)^P\f$.  
For \e N = 32 and \e P = 4 this is approximately \f$10^{17}\f$.

Below are some examples of partitioning a 16 x 16 grid with unit costs.

One can try to predict the optimal partitioning using the shape of the
sub-grid bounding boxes..  This assumes that the costs
are equal and can only be used for small partitions.

climb with the partition size.  This information is summarized in the table
below.  From this one can assess the potential benefits of using mixed-mode
